## 👋 What is this?
**IPS Suite** connects your computer files to Roblox Studio. Since Roblox cannot directly access your hard drive for security reasons, this lightweight server acts as a **safe bridge**.

It allows you to:
- Select images/videos from your PC.
- Convert pixels into data.
- Send that data to the Roblox Plugin to build efficiently.
